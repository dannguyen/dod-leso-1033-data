# U.S. military surplus gear transferred to law enforcement agencies (LESO 1033 Program)

## About the data

The data comes from spreadsheets downloaded from: 

- [the official DoD LESO 1033 page (as of 2020)](https://www.dla.mil/DispositionServices/Offers/Reutilization/LawEnforcement/PublicInformation/)
- copies of the DoD spreadsheets [as meticulously gathered and mirrored over the years by the Marshall Project](https://github.com/themarshallproject/dod1033)
- what I could scrounge using the Internet Archive and plain guessing URLs


Check out [data_inventory.yaml](./data_inventory.yaml) to see where each data file, as found in [data/collected/disp](data/collected/disp), is sourced.

The sheriff’s office in nearby Campbell County, which has just 48,000 residents, helped itself to a $658,000 Mine-Resistant Ambush Protected Vehicle, or MRAP, in 2013 and a $733,000 version the following year. In the capital city of Cheyenne, police ordered a pair of MRAPs worth a combined $1.42 million.
