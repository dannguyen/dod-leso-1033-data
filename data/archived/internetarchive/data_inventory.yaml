    California Agency Inventory as of 06-25-2014.xlsx

    Curated by Cal OES from the (federal) Law Enforcement Support Office database dated June 25, 2014.  This is a snapshot in time and may not reflect more recent transactions within the LESO's dynamically changing database.  This is the same place where Cal OES auditors pull their lists to do individual agency accountability checks throughout the year.  This spreadsheet is the only inventory list Cal OES retains outside of the LESO database - there are no historical inventories retained by Cal OES.  Certain information was redacted from the spreadsheet, including national stock numbers, serial numbers and code to prevent these identifying numbers from being used for fraudulent purposes.
