    <ol>
        <li>DEMIL Code "G". This code applies to both unclassified and classified AE items.
            <br>a. The appropriate Controlled Inventory Item Codes (CIIC) in the Federal Logistics Information System (FLIS) Table 61, Volume 10 of DOD 4100.39M, shall be assigned to categorize classification, security and
                storage applications.<br>b. The Military Services have DEMIL and disposal responsibility according to DOD Instruction 5160.68.</li>
        <br><li>DEMIL Code "P". DEMIL of these items consists of:
            <br>a. Destruction to reduce the risk of reconstituting classified information. Declassification can only be
                determined based on information from the original classification authority Original Classification Authority (OCA)
                according to DOD 5200.1-R.
            <br>b. DEMIL and removal of any sensitive markings or information accomplished and certified prior to physical
                transfer to a DLA Disposition Services or release from DOD control.
            <br>c. For Communication Security (COMSEC) items, refer to Volume 3 of the DEMIL Manual.
            <br>d. This code does not apply to AE.</li>
        <br><li>DEMIL Code "F". This code requires special instructions for DEMIL required property
            <br>a. The purpose for the instructions is to identify special provisions; e.g.; environmental, safety, and health
                hazards; required occupational expertise, and specific disposition directions.
            <br>b. Disposal activities should not accept DEMIL code "F" items for processing without the National Stock
                Number (NSN) and instructions provided. (See Volume 1 of the DEMIL Manual for more information on DEMIL
                code "F" instructions.)</li>
        <br><li>DEMIL Code "C". Key points include designed parts, components, alignment points, attachment fittings or areas
                which, when demilitarized, cannot feasibly be restored and which are necessary factors in restoring the next
                higher assembly to design capability; e.g., "gun barrel, up-armor kit, aircraft fuselage, wing spar attachment
                fittings." (See glossary for the definition of "Key points for DEMIL.".)
                <br>a. Key points are assigned or treated as DEMIL code "D". The remaining residual portion shall, at a
                    minimum, be processed as DEMIL code "B" or "Q."
                <br> b. Items submitted to a DRMO for disposal must have either the key points already removed or the key
                     points positively identified and tagged for removal by the DRMO or other disposal activity. Key point NSNs, if
                     applicable, shall be identified on the Disposal Turn-In Document, as well as on any attached identification tags.
                </li>
        <br><li>DEMIL Code "D". DEMIL to the level of scrap will ensure the requirements for this code have been met. (See
                DODI 2030.08 for the definition of scrap.) Property sold with DEMIL as a condition of sale shall not be released
                without positive controls and the DEMIL witnessed by U.S. Government representatives unless otherwise
                authorized by the DOD DEMIL Program Manager (DDPM).</li>
        <br><li>DEMIL Code "E". The DDPO reserves this code for their use only. DOD personal property assigned this code
                may be pending a commodity jurisdiction and are generally treated as DEMIL code "D."</li>
        <br><li>DEMIL Code "B". Mutilation to the point of scrap required worldwide after reutilization within DOD, Foreign
                Military Sale (FMS) programs, Federal agencies, and designated special programs. (See DOD 4160.21-M).</li>
        <br><li>DEMIL Code "Q". This code is specifically for Commerce Control List Items (CCLI) that are under the
                jurisdiction of the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS), United States Department of Commerce, according to
                parts 730 through 774 of Title 15 Code of Federal Regulation and indicated on the Commerce Control List
                (CCL) by a five-digit Export Control Classification Number (ECCN). DEMIL code "Q" items are further
                categorized as sensitive or non-sensitive based on criteria established by the DDPM.
                <Br>a. CCLI identified as sensitive requires mutilation inside the United States. Such property is assigned a
                    DEMIL Integrity Code (IC) of "3" in accordance with Volume 1 of the DEMIL Manual.
                    <br>b. CCLI identified as non-sensitive requires DOD TSC inside the United States according to DOD Instruction
                        2030.08. Such property is assigned a DEMIL IC of "6" in accordance with Volume 1 of the DEMIL Manual. CCLI
                        with a DEMIL IC of "6" does not require mutilation prior to release within the United States.
                        <br>c. Mutilation is required outside the United States and its territories for all CCLI</li>
        <br><li>DEMIL Code "A". This code is for items that are neither MLI nor CCLI. Items that have not been modified or
                redesigned and which are identical in design, structure, composition and utility to an equivalent item in the
                commercial market, will be coded DEMIL code "A". For export purposes, these items are still subject to the EAR
                as "EAR99" according to part 734 of Title 15 Code of Federal Regulation.</li>
